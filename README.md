**Ticketing Platform on XRPL**

Inspiration:
This project was inspired by my sister's experience when her Ticketmaster account got hacked, and her VIP tickets to see Seventeen were stolen. I initially wanted to work on introducing price caps on ticket resales, but as many companies are already considering integrating blockchain into their ticketing systems, I wanted to find another use case that would focus more on building fan loyalty and fostering more engaged interactions between fans an artists. 

What it does:
This ticketing platform allows artists to mint NFT tickets and create offers to sell them on the XRP Ledger. Buyers can make offers on available tickets, and the platform ensures secure, traceable ownership transfers. By leveraging blockchain, this platform would provide a safe and verifiable way to manage ticket ownership and transactions.

How I built it:
I used the XRPL JavaScript library to interact with the XRP blockchain, implementing core functions such as minting NFTs, creating sell offers, and submitting buy offers. The application includes an artist and buyer interface for interacting with the ledger, which I plan to further separate and expand as I refine the functionality of buy offers. I set up accounts, seeded wallets, and used the XRP TestNet for testing transactions.

Challenges I ran into:
Initially, I tried to use React for this project, but since this was my first experience with frontend development, the learning curve was steep, and I struggled with the basics of setting up my project. Transaction validation on the XRP Ledger was also challenging, where I faced a major issue with malformed transactions and managing the timing of requests. Additionally, I gave myself a tight deadline to learn blockchain concepts, the XRPL, frontend development, and React all at once, which was a significant challenge. Combining these unfamiliar technologies and concepts in such a short timeframe was difficult, but also rewarding.

What I learned:
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in blockchain development and full-stack development, especially working with NFTs and frontend interactions. I learned about the intricacies of submitting transactions, designing and building economies on web platforms, and considering user experience in a decentralized system. It was exciting to work on an idea that applies blockchain technology to solve real-world problems in an innovative way. Although I didn’t complete as much of the project as I’d hoped, this was an incredible learning experience that has boosted my confidence to tackle future projects with more complex technologies.
